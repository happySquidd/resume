                <article class="p4">I am a current student at WGU working toward a Bachelor of Information Technology
                    degree. I am very ambitious and passionate about solving real life problems with my coding knowledge. I love learning new things and I love helping people,
                     being a software developer helps me satisfy both of those needs. I love creating code that helps people save time or in other ways. 
                     My current goals are to focus on school and become a professional and credited programmer.

                    <p><strong>Creator of <em>TrackU</em></strong></p>
                    <article class="p4">Created an app that helps users easily track their calories in a satisfying way thanks to the simplistic app design. 
                        The goal of this app was to simplify calorie tracking and reduce distractions that other apps would implement such as ads and over-complicating 
                        the process. Creating this app in Flutter was my first experience in android app development and I learned a lot. The project was a success and awaiting 
                        final publication after several successful closed testing trials.

                    <p><strong>Backend Software Engineering bootcamp with <em>Course Careers</em></strong></p>
                    <article class="p4">Passing a rigorous backend bootcamp with Course Careers has taught me a lot about the basics and the process of backend development.
                         I learned to work with SQL, PostgreSQL, database design, search algorithms and more with real life examples and AWS deployment.

                    <p><strong>Creating a Program to simplify Billing</strong></p>
                    <article class="p4">I have made an program for a client to simplify file management and calculating tenant billing costs. As per customer specification I had created 
                         a python program that fit specific client needs with the goal of simplifying the process of tenant billing calculations and bill file management in their database. 
                         This project taught me about extracting data from PDF's and honed in my file management skills.
